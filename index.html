This part should involve the variable of integration.\n\n Express 'du' in terms of the original variable of integration (e.g., du = f(x) dx).\n\n Substitute the expressions for 'u' and 'du' into the original integral.\n\n Solve the new integral in terms of 'u'.\n\n Substitute the original expression for 'u' back into the solution to obtain the final answer in terms of the original variable.\n\n Choose a function 'u' whose derivative 'du' is simple to integrate.\n\n Let 'dv' be the remaining part of the integrand.\n\n Then, v = ∫ dv (find the antiderivative of 'dv').\n\n Apply the integration by parts formula: ∫ u dv = u v - ∫ v du \n\n Substitute the expressions for u, dv, v, and du into the formula.\n\n Evaluate the resulting integrals on both sides to find the antiderivative.\n\n Here's an example: \n\n 1) Identify the part of the integrand that can be substituted with a new variable 'u'. This part should involve the variable of integration.\n\n Let u = 2x + 3 (the part we want to substitute)\n\n2) Express 'du' in terms of the original variable of integration (e.g., du = f(x) dx).\n\n Then, du = 2 dx (by taking the derivative of 'u' with respect to 'x')\n\n 3) Substitute the expressions for 'u' and 'du' into the original integral.\n\n∫ (2x + 3)^5 dx = (1/2) ∫ u^5 du (since du = 2 dx)\n\n4) Solve the new integral in terms of 'u'.\n\n = (1/2) * (u^6/6) + C (integrating u^5 with respect to 'u')\n\n 5) Substitute the original expression for 'u' back into the solution to obtain the final answer in terms of the original variable.\n\n = (1/12) * (2x + 3)^6 + C\n\n"

Typically, u is chosen to be a function that becomes simpler when differentiated, and dv is chosen to be a function that is easy to integrate.\n\n 3) Integrate dv to find v:\n\n 4) Solve the new integral in terms of 'u'.\n\n 5) Apply the integration by parts formula: ∫udv=uv-∫vdu\n\n Heres an example: \n\n ∫xe^xdx.\n\n Let u=x (algebraic) Let dv = e^x(exponential) \n\n Derive U and Integrate dV: du=1dx v=e^x \n\n Plug into the function ∫xe^xdx=xe^x −∫e^xdx"

                example: "Here are the Steps:\n\n Arrange the polynomial in descending order of powers of x.\n\n Write the coefficients of the polynomial in a row, leaving a space at the beginning for the divisor (x - a).\n\n Bring down the leading coefficient of the polynomial into the space at the beginning.\n\n Multiply this leading coefficient by 'a' (the constant in the divisor) and write the result below the next coefficient of the polynomial.\n\n Subtract this result from the coefficient directly below it, and bring down the result.\n\n Repeat steps 4 and 5 until you reach the constant term of the polynomial. \n\n The coefficients in the row, excluding the initial divisor, represent the quotient polynomial. \n\n The last number in the row is the remainder of the division. \n\n Here's an example: 2x^3 + 3x^2 - 4x + 5, x-2\n\n Coefficients: 2,3,-4,5 Divisor: X-2 (A=2) \n\n Here's the link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eifR8Jhj8Bmcy29rzm66JNCKeXv5ol9pqCIisFiAFcM/edit?usp=sharing"
